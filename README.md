# Model-Evaluation-and-Refinement
Model Evaluation and Refinement on Laptop pricing dv
Hands-on Practice Lab: Model Evaluation and Refinement
Estimated time needed: 45 minutes

In this lab, you will use the skills acquired throughout the module, and try to refine your model's performance in predicting the price of a laptop, given the attribute values.







Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use training, testing and cross validation to improve the performance of the dataset.
Identify the point of overfitting of a model
Use Ridge Regression to identify the change in performance of a model based on its hyperparameters
Use Grid Search to identify the best performing model using different hyperparameters
